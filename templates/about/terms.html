	information submitted by you is accurate to the best of your knowledge
	or ability; and (c) you are not violating the rights of any third party
	by submitting Personal Information to the Service.<br>
	6. FEES FOR SERVICE<br>
	6.1 General. All or portions of the Service may be
	provided for free or for a recurring subscription fee. You will be
	notified in advance via a pop-up screen on the Website or the App
	before signing up for any portion of the Service for which a recurring
	subscription fee is charged. You will have to manifest your consent to
	obtain fee-based services by clicking an Accept button on the Website.
	Once you click Accept, you will be subject to the recurring
	subscription fee that you have accepted for the period of time
	selected, and you agree to pay in full such amount.<br>
	6.2 Taxes. All recurring subscription fees are
	exclusive of any applicable taxes (value added taxes, sales, use, etc.)
	unless otherwise stated, and you are solely responsible for the payment
	of any applicable taxes that may be imposed upon you for use of the
	Service.<br>
	6.3 Free Trial Period. Certain fee-based portions of
	the Service may be available for a one-time free trial period (a 'Trial
	Period'). The duration of a Trial Period will be identified for you
	when you register for the Trial Period. In order to register for a
	Trial Period, you will be required to provide credit card information
	in accordance with Section 6.4 and create a User account. When you
	create a user account that is subject to a Trial Period, you will be
	notified of the length of the trial period and the date by which you
	must cancel to avoid having your credit card charged. Unless you
	terminate your Trial Period prior to the end of such Trial Period, your
	credit card will be charged the recurring subscription fee applicable
	at the time you signed up for the Trial Period. If at any time you wish
	to know how much time is remaining in your trial period, this
	information is available under the 'Account' tab from within the
	application. We will send a notice to the e-mail account you used to
	register for the Trial Period at least 5 days prior to the end of the
	Trial Period to remind you of the pending expiration of the Trial
	Period and the fact that you will be subject to fees after termination
	of the Trial Period unless you terminate your User account. You may
	cancel your account at any time during the Trial Period by clicking the
	'Account' tab from within the web application. Upon cancelling your
	User account, you will lose all access to the Service and any and all
	data or information associated with your User account.<br>
	6.4 Payment Method. Subscription fees must be paid
	using a lawfully issued credit card for which you have authorization to
	make a charge. InnerGraphics may seek pre-authorization of your credit
	card prior to permitting you to register for a fee-based aspect of the
	Service to verify the validity of your credit card. Your credit card
	provider may reduce your available balance by any amount pre-authorized
	against your credit card. You should speak with your credit card
	provider to understand their pre-authorization policies. You must
	maintain a valid credit card on file with InnerGraphics while receiving
	fee-based Services. If any charge to your credit card is rejected for
	any reason, then you agree to provide updated credit card information
	upon request by InnerGraphics and to pay any balances due.
	InnerGraphics reserves the right to block access to your User account
	until such time as a valid credit card is provided to cover all charges
	incurred by you. You are solely responsible for any late fees or other
	charges incurred by you as a result of your use of a credit card to pay
	a subscription fee.<br>
	6.5 Monthly and Annual Subscriptions.<br>
	(a) Payment Frequency. InnerGraphics may offer
	fee-based services on a monthly or annual subscription basis. Both
	options are auto-renewal, meaning that once you sign up for either the
	monthly or annual subscription, your credit card will be charged the
	renewal fee at the end of the period for which you have registered for
	a subsequent renewal period. The renewal fee charged to your account
	will be the fee then in effect for the period for which you are
	renewing. Renewal notices willnotbe sent to you if you elect a monthly
	subscription but a renewal notice will be sent to you approximately 30
	days prior to the renewal of an annual subscription. If you fail to
	terminate your account prior to any periodic renewal, then your credit
	card will be charged the full amount for the renewal period.<br>
	(b) Changes in Subscription Fees. InnerGraphics may
	change subscription fees at any time and from time to time. You will be
	notified of any price changes either via e-mail or through a pop-up
	window on the Website or the App, or both. Continued use of the Service
	following a price change constitutes your acceptance of the applicable
	price change. If you object to any price changes adopted by
	InnerGraphics, then your sole remedy is to discontinue use of the
	Service and terminate your account prior to your credit card being
	charged a recurring subscription fee at the changed rate. The
	provisions of this paragraph are subject to all applicable local laws.<br>
	6.6 Timing of Charges. Renewal fees are charged to
	your credit card on or about the anniversary of your initial
	subscription<br>
	6.7 Managing Your Account Information. You can
	manage and update your credit card information for fee-based services
	by clicking on the 'Account' tab in the web application.<br>
	6.8 Cancellation of Subscription Services; No
	Refunds. You may cancel your subscription to any fee based service
	offered by InnerGraphics at any time by clicking on the 'Account' tab
	in the web application. However, all payments are final and thereare no
	refunds offered for the early termination of any period for which you
	have paid a subscription fee (including renewal periods). Local law may

	19. United States Export Controls<br>
	You agree to comply with all export laws and
	restrictions and regulations of the United States Department of
	Commerce or other United States or other sovereign agency or authority
	when using the Website, the App or the Service, and not to export, or
	allow the export or re-export of any technical data or any direct
	product of any of the foregoing in violation of any such restrictions,
	laws or regulations, or unless and until all required licenses and
	authorizations are obtained with respect to the countries specified in
	the applicable United States Export Administration Regulations (or any
	successor supplement or regulations). The transfer of certain technical
	data and commodities may require a license from an agency of the United
	States government and/or written assurances by you that you will not
	export such technical data or commodities to certain foreign countries
	without prior approval of such agency. Your rights under these Terms
	are contingent on your compliance with this provision.<br>
	20. Miscellaneous<br>
	20.1 Notice. InnerGraphics may provide you with
	notices, including those regarding changes to these Terms, by postings
	on the Website or the App, via electronic mail, or by postal delivery.
	Notice sent via e-mail will be deemed given twenty-four hours after
	such e-mail is sent, unless InnerGraphics is notified that the
	electronic mail address is invalid. Alternatively, we may give you
	legal notice by mail to a postal address, if provided by you. In such
	case, notice will be deemed given three days after the date of mailing.
	Notice given via the Website or the App will be deemed given upon the
	earlier of 5 days following posting on the Website or the Web App or
	when first reviewed by you.<br>
	20.2 Dispute Resolution. If a dispute arises between
	you and InnerGraphics, our goal is to provide you with a neutral and
	cost effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. Accordingly, you
	and InnerGraphics agree that we will resolve any claim or controversy
	at law or equity that arises out of these Terms (a 'Claim') in
	accordance with one of the subsections below or as InnerGraphics and
	you otherwise agree in writing. Before resorting to these alternatives,
	we strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a
	resolution. We will consider reasonable requests to resolve the dispute
	through alternative dispute resolution procedures, such as mediation or
	arbitration, as alternatives to litigation.<br>
	(a) Choice of Law; Forum. These Terms shall be
	governed in all respects by the laws of the State of New York and the
	United States of America. You agree that any claim or dispute you may
	have against InnerGraphics must be resolved by a court located in
	Suffolk County, Massachusetts, except as otherwise agreed by you and
	InnerGraphics or as described in the Arbitration Option paragraph
	below. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal
	and state courts located within Suffolk County, Massachussetts for the
	purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes, and hereby waive any
	claims or defenses that such courts are an inconvenient forum.<br>
	(b) Arbitration Option. For any claim (excluding
	claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount
	of the award sought is less than $5,000, the party requesting relief
	may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through
	binding non-appearance-based arbitration. In the event a party elects
	arbitration, they shall initiate such arbitration through an
	established alternative dispute resolution ('ADR') provider mutually
	agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must
	comply with the following rules: (i) the arbitration shall be conducted
	by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the
	specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the
	arbitration; (ii) the arbitration shall not involve any personal
	appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed
	by the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award rendered by the
	arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any
	ADR provider chosen under this Section 20.2(b) must be located in an
	office based in, or be a permanent resident of, Manhattan County, New
	York.<br>
	(c) Improperly Filed Claims. All claims you bring
	against InnerGraphics must be resolved in accordance with this Section
	20.2 (Dispute Resolution).<br>
	All claims filed or brought contrary to this Section
	20.2 (Dispute Resolution) shall be considered improperly filed. Should
	you file a claim contrary to this Section 20.2 (Dispute Resolution),
	InnerGraphics may recover attorneys' fees and costs up to $5,000,
	provided that InnerGraphics has notified you in writing of the
	improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the
	claim.<br>
	20.3 Waiver. A provision of these Terms may be
	waived only by a written instrument executed by the party entitled to
	the benefit of such provision. The failure of InnerGraphics to exercise
	or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a
	waiver of such right or provision.<br>
	20.4 Severability. In the event that the application
	of any provision of these Terms to any particular facts or
	circumstances shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable under the
	law hereof, then: (a) such provision shall be reformed without further
	action by the Parties to the extent strictly necessary to render such
	provision valid and enforceable when applied to such particular facts
	or circumstances; and (b) the validity and enforceability of such
	provision as applied to any other particular facts or circumstances,
	and the validity and enforceability of all of the other provisions of
	these Terms, shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby.<br>
	20.5 Assignment. The Terms and related Guidelines
	(if any), and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be
	transferred or assigned by you, whether by sale, merger, operation of
	law, or otherwise, without InnerGraphics's prior written consent, but
	may be assigned by InnerGraphics without restriction. Any assignment
	attempted to be made in violation of these Terms shall be void. These
	Terms shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
	hereto, and their permitted successors, heirs, and assigns.<br>
	20.6 No Agency. You agree that no joint venture,
	partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and
	InnerGraphics as a result of these Terms or use of the InnerGraphics
	Properties.<br>
	20.7 Survival. Sections 7 ('Ownership; Proprietary
	Rights'), 10.2 ('Password'), 14 ('Indemnification; Hold Harmless'), 15
	('Disclaimers; No Warranties'), 16 ('Limitation of Liability and
	Damages'), 17 ('Limitations by Applicable Law; Basis of the Bargain'),
	and 19 ('Miscellaneous') will survive any termination of these Terms.<br>
	20.8 Headings. The heading references herein are for
	convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of these Terms, and
	shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.<br>
	20.9 Entire Agreement. This is the entire agreement
	between you and InnerGraphics relating to the subject matter herein and
	supersedes all previous communications, representations,
	understandings, and agreements, either oral or written, between the
	parties with respect to said subject matter. These Terms shall not be
	modified except in a writing signed by both parties, or by a change to
	these Terms made by InnerGraphics as set forth in Section 4 above.<br>
