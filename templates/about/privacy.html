	consent to HealerSource's collection and use of information from
	or about you as well as information related to your use of the

	regarding whether and if you will use the Service.<br />
	We may use or share your Personal Information (e.g., name,
	address, telephone number, email address, and location) where it
	is necessary for us to complete a transaction or do something that
	you have asked us to do.<br />
	How HealerSource collects and uses information from you:<br />
	* Website, Web App, or App Usage. HealerSource (or its vendors
	and suppliers) may observe your activities, preferences, and
	transactional data (such as your IP address and browser type) as
	well as content you have viewed during your use of the Service. We
	may use this data for any purpose unless we tell you otherwise in
	connection with a particular Service. While we may collect or log
	this information, we do not identify you or match this
	non-Personal Information with your other Personal Information.<br />
	* Customer Service. If you purchase a paid Service offered by
	HealerSource you may be asked for information needed to complete
	your request and provide related customer service. This
	information you provide is used, for example, to process your
	transactions, to create and share aggregate reports about these
	transactions, and for any risk management functions relating to
	transactions. If you purchase a subscription Service, your
	transaction may be conducted through our vendors and suppliers.
	Vendors and suppliers engaged by Conscious may have their use of
	your Personal Information limited by this Privacy Policy,
	contractual restrictions, and applicable law. HealerSource
	(through its vendors or suppliers) may limit its provision of
	services to particular jurisdictions and as permitted by
	applicable law.<br />
	* Development of the HealerSource Service; Scientific
	Research. In our mission to better understand fertility cycles and
	help women make powerful and informed choices around their
	fertility, HealerSource will use your fertility data anonymously
	in our own research to better understand human fertility and
	improve our products and services. We may also share anonymous
	Personal Information with third-party researchers. Personal
	Information we share with a third party will be anonymous and not
	associated with your name or any identifying information provided
	by HealerSource.<br />
	* Technical and Administrative Support. HealerSource may allow
	you to provide registration information to us associated with a
	particular HealerSource Service or products. HealerSource may also
	use the information you provide in online registration forms to
	notify you periodically about important changes to the Service
	(such as a change to this Privacy Policy or notice of a security
	breach), and new products and services and related features. If
	you register, we may ask for, among other things, your name,
	address, email, telephone number, type of product purchased, or
	other product-identifying information.<br />
	* Promotions, and Contests. You may be asked to provide
	Personal Information, for entry into a particular promotion or
	contest, so that we can let you know if you won a prize. The
	specific rules and regulations governing the particular promotion
	or contest will vary and your participation constitutes your
	agreement to abide by those rules and regulations.<br />
	* Marketing. When you provide HealerSource with Personal
	Information, we may communicate with you using the information you
	have given us to provide you with information we think may be of
	interest to you including marketing and promotional messages. For
	special offers and promotions we will provide you with an
	opportunity to opt-out of receiving further similar
	communications.<br /><br />

	understand how the Service is used, to develop and improve the
	Service, to personalize your online experience, and for

	WHEN HEALERSOURCE MAY SHARE COLLECTED INFORMATION<br />
	In addition to the circumstances noted above, HealerSource may
	also share your Personal Information with third parties in the
	following situations:<br />
	* Enabling Services. HealerSource contracts with other
	companies in order to enable provision of the Service. For
	example, web based services require web hosting, thus HealerSource
	may contract with web hosting service providers.<br />
	* Public Areas. The Service may include forums for
	communicating with others; such forums are public areas. Any
	information disclosed in such public areas of the Service or on
	any other website (Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, etc.) will become
	public information. You should exercise caution when disclosing
	information in these public areas, especially your health-related
	and other sensitive information. Content posted in public areas of

	* Business Changes. If HealerSource should ever file for
	bankruptcy or merge with another company, or if HealerSource

	business, HealerSource may be required to disclose your Personal
	Information to prospective or actual purchasers in connection with
	one of these transactions.<br />
	* As Required by Law and Other Extraordinary Disclosures.
	HealerSource may be required to disclose your Personal Information
	if it: (i) believes it is reasonably necessary to comply with
	legal process (such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant,
	etc.) or other legal requirements of any governmental authority,
	(ii) would potentially mitigate our liability in an actual or
	potential lawsuit, (iii) is otherwise necessary to protect our
	rights or property, or (iv) is necessary to protect the legal
	rights or property of others.<br /><br />
	YOUR RIGHT TO ACCESS, MAKE CHANGES TO, OR REQUEST DELETION OF
	PERSONAL INFORMATION<br />
	You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your
	Personal Information. For instructions on changing any of your

	SECURITY<br />
	* Data Transmission. No data transmissions over the Internet
	can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Thus, HealerSource cannot
	ensure or warrant the security of any information that you
	transmit to us. You use the Service at your own risk. Once we
	receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure
	security on our systems. However, this is not a guarantee that
	such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or
	destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.<br />
	* In the event of a security breach. If HealerSource learns of
	a security system's breach, we may attempt to notify you
	electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
	By using the Service or providing Personal Information to us, you
	agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding
	security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use
	of the Service. Also, HealerSource may post a notice on the
	Website or the App if a security breach occurs. If this happens,
	you will need a web browser or mobile device enabling you to view
	the Service. HealerSource may also send an email to you at the
	email address you have provided to us in these circumstances.
	Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive
	notice of a security breach in writing.<br />
	To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to
	withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you must
	notify us at <a title="Contact HealerSource" class="contact" href=""></a>.<br /><br />
	REMARKETING INFORMATION<br />
	We use Google AdWords Remarketing to advertise across the Internet. AdWords remarketing will display relevant ads tailored to you based on what parts of the HealerSource website you have viewed by placing a cookie on your machine. THIS COOKIE DOES NOT IN ANYWAY IDENTIFY YOU OR GIVE ACCESS TO YOUR COMPUTER. The cookie is used to say "This person visited this page, so show them ads relating to that page."

	information through the Website or the App, and we learn the
	person submitting the information is a child, we will attempt to

	HealerSource reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy
	in the future. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy that are
	materially less restrictive on our use of personal information
	than we have previously collected we will make reasonable efforts
	to obtain your consent to provide notice and obtain your consent
	to any such uses. We will post the updated Privacy Policy through
